pySPECCHIO is a Python interface and command line utility to upload raw data such as spectra and metadata into the [SPECCHIO spectral information system](http://specchio.ch/). It uses the [JPype](http://jpype.sourceforge.net/) Python-Java bridge package to communicate with the [SPECCHIO API](http://www.specchio.ch/doc/index.html) (written in Java by the SPECCHIO developers). 

pySPECCHIO is currently configured to work with a specific field campaign at the University of Edinburgh, but you are welcome to fork and modify it for your own use.

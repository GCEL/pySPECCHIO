# pySPECCHIO

pySPECCHIO is a Python interface and command line utility to upload raw data such as spectra and metadata into the SPECCHIO spectral information system. It uses the JPype Python-Java bridge package to communicate with the SPECCHIO API (written in Java by the SPECCHIO developers). 

pySPECCHIO is currenly configured to work with a specific field campaign at the University of Edinburgh, but you are welcome to fork and modify it for your own use.
